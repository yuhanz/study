Lunar-lander:
- The end is pain.
- Let the process be a reward at the end:
    collect only the positive result
    *positive result!
- Let survival be a reward:
    The longer of survival, the less of the pain.
    (When the end reward is positive, the process would shorten the process as well.)
    *negative result
- Once having a success, amplify the success as training data
    save the success steps and reward for future training
